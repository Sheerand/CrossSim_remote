# Documentation

CrossSim Inference Manual v2.0 is a comprehensive guide to using CrossSim to run inference simulations.

CrossSim Manual v0.3 is an older manual from 2017 that documents the usage of CrossSim's neural core back end. Some of the information in this document is outdated (e.g. installation instructions) and the newer neural core features implemented for CrossSim Inference are not included.

More extensive documentation of CrossSim Training and backend usage will be released in a future update.
